# Project Name

This project showcases my React Router skills, utilization of Material UI, creation of a custom data API, and error handling with a 404 page. The repository contains a React.js application that revolves around the theme of travels.

Features

* Explore Travel Destinations: Users can browse through a curated list of travel destinations, each showcasing captivating images and essential details.
    
* Custom Data API: The project includes a custom data API in the form of an array of objects, providing the necessary information about the travel destinations.
    
* Error Handling: In the event of a user navigating to a non-existent page or entering an invalid URL, the application displays a 404 error page, ensuring a user-friendly experience.
* [Optional Feature]: The Tabs component is also included in the project, demonstrating the implementation of tabs in React.js, although not utilized in the main application.

# External Images

>I do use some external images, which are not lightweight, so while rendering, it might take a few seconds to load. However, it is not the area of focus. Please forgive me for that because the main motive of this project is to showcase the skills of React Router.
